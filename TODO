TODO

Short-Term:
- implement event bubbling
- finish implementing actions in TextContext

Mid-Term:
- develop Round Table modules (aka Knights?) that provide data/scenarios and
  additional related functionality e.g. specialized controllers
  - use similar structure to Rails plugins, e.g. modules/<knight>/init.rb

Long-Term:
- for exploration/overworld controller, develop ActionResponder class that can
  respond to a set of actions, e.g. a door might respond to open, listen, and
  break.
